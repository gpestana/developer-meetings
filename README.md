You should submit your talk abstract by opening an issue in this repo following the issue template.

## FAQs

### Who is this event for?  

This is a working meeting for developers and users of libp2p.  If you work on libp2p, or use it in a downstream project, you are a good fit.

### Iâ€™m already attending the [IPFS Meeting](https://github.com/ipfs/developer-meetings) earlier in the week.  Is it ok if I just stick around for the libp2p days?

This is a completely separate event from the IPFS Developers Meeting, with its own admission criteria.  If you are an active contributor to libp2p (or a downstream user of libp2p), you are absolutely welcome to attend.
